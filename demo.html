          Give thanks to the most high. Look at the sunset, life is amazing, life is beautiful, life is what you make it. In life you have to take the trash out, if you have trash in your life, take it out, throw it away, get rid of it, major key.

          <p>
            Passing a negative <var>data-parallax-y-by</var> value will cause
            the element to be 'reluctant' to leave the viewport.

            Very large values may have interesting effects.

            Nope, you can't parallax other properties, but the
            <var>translate3d</var> transform can simulate some of them quite
            well. This section is simulating the <var>background-position</var>
            property by using an absolutely positioned element and
            <var>data-parallax-y-by="2"</var>.

            It was very little extra effort to make this work in the X
            dimension as well, so I did!
